/*
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA,
it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

For example,
Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",
Return: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].

public:
    vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        vector<string> v;
        for(int i = 0, r = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
            if(m[r = r << 3 & 0x3fffffff | s[i] & 7]++ == 1)
                v.push_back(s.substr(i - 9, 10));
        return v;
    }
