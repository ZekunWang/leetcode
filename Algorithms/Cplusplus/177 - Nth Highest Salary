Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. 
If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
set N=N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      
      #select salary from Employee group by salary order by salary desc limit N, 1
      select distinct salary from Employee order by salary desc limit N, 1
  );
END
